# heatmap

This is the repository for RPIA's run heatmap, currently available at http://rpia.w1bbb.com. The admin page can be set to be accessed at the URL of your choice (currently, on the production site, it is behind password protection).

## Addition of locations
There are two ways to add events at specific locations.

### 1. Saved locations
The first way is to select a saved location, the latitude and longitude of should be stored in `/add/js/locations.json`. Text input searching is available, as well, for all saved locations.

### 2. Geoencoding or direct lat/long input
The second way is to search using customary address input. This particular package utilizes Google Map's geoencoding feature, which is very flexible. Inputs such as
>123 main st, anytown, ny

>1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, DC

>Statue of Liberty, NY

all work just as well. Zip codes can be used in place of city and state, and, usually, states can be left off entirelyâ€”so long as Google knows your current location.

## Bulk input

For both location input methods, a numerical selector is available to bulk-add events at single locations.

## Installation
Simply drop all the contained files in the web location of your choosing. Check out `/js/map.js` and `/add/js/info.js`, and add your Google Maps API key and other info in the appropriate locations.
